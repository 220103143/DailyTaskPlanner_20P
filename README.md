TaskPlanner
Introduction
Our  project is a Task Planner designed to help students like us stay organized and manage our time better. It lets you list your tasks, set deadlines, and keep track of what needs to be done. The goal is to make planning easier and less stressful, so it’s not overwhelming when you have a lot on your plate. It’s a simple way to stay focused and avoid falling behind.
Problem Statement
Many students, including ourself, often feel overwhelmed trying to balance school, homework, personal life, and other responsibilities. It’s easy to lose track of deadlines, forget important tasks, or leave things until the last minute. This creates a lot of unnecessary stress and can hurt our grades and overall well-being. The real issue is that we don’t always have a simple, reliable way to organize everything in one place. Our Task Planner aims to solve this by offering an easy-to-use tool that helps students plan their days, set priorities, and keep track of tasks. By staying organized, we can reduce stress, avoid procrastination, and feel more in control. This kind of tool is especially important for building good habits and managing time better in the long run.
Objectives
The goal of our  project is to help students stay organized and manage their tasks with less stress. It’s designed to improve time management, encourage better planning habits, and make handling schoolwork feel easier and more manageable.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
